TITLE='Kaseta  â€”  Saturating tape delay and feedback sculptor'
DESCRIPTION='Kaseta is a multi-purpose module inspired by reel-to-reel tape machines. It simulates magnetic hysteresis to provide warm saturation, its four independent delay lines can be used to sculpt rhythms or feedback loops, and it offers wow and flutter control. The module also goes beyond typical tape machine features, with free-moving delays, trigger sequencing, and an internal oscillator.'
