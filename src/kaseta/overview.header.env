TITLE='Kaseta  â€”  Saturating tape delay and feedback sculptor'
DESCRIPTION='TODO This eurorack module allows you to do many things, but in essence, it is just a bunch of oscillators that never go out of tune or out of scale! Apart from playing anything between lush pads and hellish walls of sound, it enables you to easily jam with other musicians and explore characters of different scales.'
