# Kanban

This page serves to track upcoming and past work and should help me stay
organized and on the right path. Let's take these tasks one by one. Using a
generated book is not a great option for Kanban, but hey, why not.

Each groomed card should contain information about motivation and the final
product. Backlog should be ordered by priority and cards on the top should be
sufficiently groomed.

## In Progress

> **Learn general Rust**
>
> * *Topic: Rust*
> * *Started: 2020-07-05*
>
> I chose to use Rust for embedded programming. It does not have that many
> resources as C, but hey, it is fun. As the result of this effort, I should
> list the resources I've used in the Rust section.
>
> I was playing with Rust couple of years back, but since then, the language
> changed quite a bit and I forgot most of it anyway. In order to re-learn Rust,
> I am using [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and also [The Rust
> Programming
> Language](https://www.amazon.de/Rust-Programming-Language-Covers-2018/dp/1718500440/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=rust&qid=1594415230&sr=8-1).
