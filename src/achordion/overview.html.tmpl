        <h3>overview</h3>
        <p>
          This module allows you to do many things but in essence it is just a
          bunch of oscillators that never go out of tune nor out of scale! Apart
          from playing anything between lush pads and hellish walls of
          sound, it enables you to easily jam with other musicians and explore
          characters of different scales. If you don't know any music theory,
          don't despair, the module will do all the harmony maths and all left
          for you to do is to use your intuition. If you on the other hand
          understand basics of music theory, with this instrument, you can
          leverage it.

        <h3>features</h3>
        <p>
          The front panel of the module is made out of aluminium with engraved
          lettering, it is available in black or light anodized finishes.

          The module is based around wavetable synthesis, and contains a
          selection of 37 wavetables, offering smooth transitions between them.

          With up to 18 simultaneous voices, it allows to enable sub-octaves,
          duplicated tones or chords.

          Four modes of playing are available â€“ single tone, selection of 18
          standard chords (fifth, sevent and ninth), arpeggios, and intervals.

          All playing tones are quantized to a configurable scale. 1V/oct inputs
          are quantized so any scale can be played with white keys of the piano.

          Two lines can be played at the same time, each controlled by an
          independent 1V/oct input. There are also two separate outputs,
          enabling to send each line to a different effect chain.

          Last but not least, a display consisting of 8 LEDs is used to make
          dialing of parameters easier and to provide visual cues.
