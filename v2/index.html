        <h2>overview</h2>
        <p>
          This module allows you to do many things but in essence it is just a
          bunch of oscillators that never go out of tune nor out of scale! Apart
          from playing anything between lush pads and hellish walls of
          sound, it enables you to easily jam with other musicians and explore
          characters of different scales. If you don't know any music theory,
          don't despair, the module will do all the harmony maths and all left
          for you to do is to use your intuition. If you on the other hand
          understand basics of music theory, with this instrument, you can
          leverage it.

        <h2>features</h2>
        <p>
          The front panel of the module is made out of aluminium with engraved
          lettering, it is available in black or light anodized finishes.

          The module is based around wavetable synthesis, and contains a
          selection of 37 wavetables, offering smooth transitions between them.

          With up to 18 simultaneous voices, it allows to enable sub-octaves,
          duplicated tones or chords.

          Four modes of playing are available – single tone, selection of 18
          standard chords (fifth, sevent and ninth), arpeggios, and intervals.

          All playing tones are quantized to a configurable scale. 1V/oct inputs
          are quantized so any scale can be played with white keys of the piano.

          Two lines can be played at the same time, each controlled by an
          independent 1V/oct input. There are also two separate outputs,
          enabling to send each line to a different effect chain.

          Last but not least, a display consisting of 8 LEDs is used to make
          dialing of parameters easier and to provide visual cues.

          <h2>installation</h2>
          <p>
            Achordion is 10 HP wide Eurorack module. It is powered by +12V/-12V
            2x5 connector. The red stripe (-12V) must be connected on the side
            of the board marked with the white line. The boxed power connector
            should make it easier to connect with the correct polarity.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="right">
          <h2>controls, inputs and outputs</h2>
          <p>
            On the left side, there is a column of <b>LEDs</b>&nbsp;(<b>X</b>) that
            are visualizing the currently selected parameter. Below the LEDs,
            there is a <b>button</b>&nbsp;(<b>Y</b>) to access
            alternative parameters of each of the knobs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>WAVETABLE</b> (<b>A</b>) knob selects the wavetable. When the
            button (<b>Y</b>) is held down, this knob scrolls through wavetable
            banks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>TONE</b> (<b>B</b>) knob selects root note that should be playing. When the
            button (<b>Y</b>) is held down, this knob is used to select tonic of
            the scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>DETUNE</b> (<b>C</b>) knob controls spread of secondary voices
            and amount of detune. When the button (<b>Y</b>) is held down, this
            knob controls the scale mode.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>CHORD</b> (<b>D</b>) knob selects the chord or interval that
            should be playing. When the button (<b>Y</b>) is held down, this
            knob selects the mode in which chords are built.
          </p>
          <p>
            CV inputs <b>TONE</b> (<b>1</b>) and <b>TONE'</b> (<b>2</b>) used to
            control the root note that are playing on the main and side line,
            respectively. When <b>TONE</b> is connected, the <b>TONE</b> knob
            controls octave offset. These inputs follow 1V/oct standard,
            between 0 and +10 V.
          </p>
          <p>
            CV inputs <b>TABLE</b> (<b>3</b>), <b>DETUNE</b> (<b>4</b>)
            and <b>CHORD</b> (<b>5</b>) are used to control the same attributes
            as the knobs described above. The value selected by the knob is
            added to the value set through CV. These inputs span between -5 and
            +5 V.
          </p>
          <p>
            Audio outputs <b>OUT</b> (<b>6</b>) and <b>OUT'</b> (<b>7</b>) play
            the main and the side line respectively. When only one is connected,
            the outputs are mixed together.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="left">
          <h2>two lines</h2>
          <p>
            The module has two lines, primary and secondary. The tone of these
            lines can be controlled independently while all the other attributes
            are shared.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary line is controlled through the <b>TONE</b> knob and CV
            input. The primary line can play a chord, controlled through
            the <b>CHORD</b> knob and CV input.
          </p>
          <p>
            The secondary line is controlled through the <b>TONE'</b> CV input
            and is playing only when a jack is connected. Unlike the primary
            line, the secondary is not playing chords.
          </p>

          <h2>wavetables</h2>
          <p>
            There are 37 wavetables to select from, divided into 4 banks:
          </p>
          <ol type="I">
            <li>
              <b>Perfect</b> – classic waveforms: triangle, sine, square and
              saw. All of these are containing pure harmonics.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Harsh</b> – full and distorted sounds. These can get very thick
              when played in rich chords.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Soft</b> – cleaner sounds and bells.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Sines</b> – the bottom half of this bank is a sequence of sine
              function multiplications providing variety of different sounds
              from clean to crazy noises. The upper half contains sums of sine
              functions, sliding through them provides a low-pass filter effect.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The transitions between wavetables within a single bank are gradual
            and very smooth, suitable for live modulation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bank can be selected by pressing the <b>button</b> (<b>Y</b>)
            while turning the <b>WAVETABLE</b> (<b>A</b>) knob.
          </p>

          <h2>detune</h2>
          <p>
            This parameter is set through the <b>DETUNE</b> knob and CV input,
            and controls number of secondary voices per each played note and
            their detune. The knob/CV input scrolls through four of these
            detune modes:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Disabled, only primary tones of the selected chord are playing.
            </li>
            <li>
              The first factor of the chord is duplicated one octave lower. This
              is a classic sub-octave.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each tone in the chord is duplicated once with a unisono. This
              produces slight movement or vibrato effect, depending on the
              amount of the detune.
            </li>
            <li>
              Two sub-octaves per each factor. This can produce very rich wall
              of sound and gets crazy with lot of detune.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            While moving through each of the modes, secondary voices are being
            gradually detuned. In lower detunes, the difference in frequency is
            very small and produces "beats" - making the sound moving and warm,
            when it is pushed higher it turns into a wild cacophony.
          </p>

          <h2>quantization</h2>
          <p>
            Quantizing makes sure that everything that comes out of the module
            stays in tune.
          </p>
          <p>
            To select root note of the scale, hold the <b>button</b> while
            turning the <b>TONE</b>
            knob. <b>LEDs</b> <b>I</b>&nbsp;through&nbsp;<b>VII</b> then
            symbolize notes of C major: C,&nbsp;D,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;B.
            The <b>#</b>&nbsp;<b>LED</b> signalizes that the note is sharp.
          </p>
          <p>
            To select the scale mode, hold the <b>button</b> while turning
            the <b>DETUNE</b> knob. <b>LEDs</b> <b>I</b> through <b>VII</b> then
            symbolize each of the modes. Selected mode affects the mood or
            character of the tune you are playing:
          </p>
          <ol type="I">
            <li>Ionian (major)</li>
            <li>Dorian</li>
            <li>Phrygian</li>
            <li>Lydian</li>
            <li>Mixolydian</li>
            <li>Aeolian (minor)</li>
            <li>Locrian</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            If you are unsure on what to dial in, keep the default root note and
            experiment with the modes.
          </p>
          <p>
            CV inputs <b>TONE</b> and <b>TONE'</b> are additionally quantized to
            the white keys of a piano keyboard. This allows to play any scale
            using only these keys.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <h2>chords</h2>
          <p>
            This module allows playing chords of up to 5 factors, each of them
            affected by the detune.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to visualize selected chords, the <b>LEDs</b> are
            displaying their factors. For example, if the selected chord is
            basic fifth, LEDs I, III and V light up to signalize that first,
            third and fifth are playing. If this does not sound like anything to
            you, don't worry and just use your ears.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, there are three different modes of playing chords.
            These can be accessed by holding the <b>button</b> while turning
            the <b>CHORD</b> knob:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Chords</b> – assorted set of 19 chords. Starting with single
              note, followed-up with fifth, seventh, ninth and ninth inversions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Intervals</b> – not chords per-se. In this mode, the root note
              is accompanied by another note of interval between minus two
              octaves to plus two octaves.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Arpeggios</b> – four different chords that are incrementally
              built while the parameter is being increased. Starting with the
              root, adding second factor, third, ...
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            You may wonder how to select minor or major chords. Thanks to
            quantization, the quality of each chord is selected automatically,
            based on the root note, in order to stay in tune.
          </p>

          <h2>split output</h2>
          <p>
            There are two audio outputs in the module: <b>OUT</b>
            and <b>OUT'</b>. When only one of these outputs is connected, it
            gets mixed with the unconnected one. When both outputs are
            connected, each plays different voices. This allows to run through
            two different effect chains.
          </p>
          <p>
            The content of these outputs depends on the playing lines. If the
            secondary line is playing, <b>OUT</b> plays the primary line,
            controlled by <b>TONE</b> and <b>OUT'</b> is playing the secondary
            line, controlled by <b>TONE'</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, when the secondary line is not connected, <b>OUT</b>
            contains the root note of the primary line, while <b>OUT'</b>
            contains the rest of the chord played by the primary line.
          </p>

          <h2>calibration</h2>
          <p>
            While inputs <b>TONE</b> and <b>TONE'</b> should match the 1V/oct
            standard by default, they may be little off, either due to used
            components or the CV source not matching the standard precisely. It
            is possible to calibrate each of these inputs individually for their
            CV source. To do so, follow this procedure:
          </p>
          <ol class="arabic">
            <li>While pressing the <b>button</b>, connect jack to the input.</li>
            <li>The left column of <b>LEDs</b> should light up.</li>
            <li>Play the note <b style="color: #aa0000;">C</b> on the CV source and press the <b>button</b>.</li>
            <li>Now the right column of <b>LEDs</b> should light up.</li>
            <li>Play the note <b style="color: #008000;">C</b> one octave higher and press the <b>button</b> again.</li>
          </ol>
          <img src="piano.svg" style="border-radius: 0; margin-bottom: 30px;">
          <p>
            If you don't use a keyboard to control <b>TONE</b> or <b>TONE'</b>,
            there is no need for calibration.
          </p>

          <h2>reset</h2>
          <p>
            Calibration and all secondary parameters (wavetable bank, scale
            tonic, scale mode, chord mode) are stored between restarts of the
            module. To reset their values, hold the <b>button</b> pressed while
            powering on the module.

          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Petr.

            I played flute and trumpet as a kid, drums as an adolescent and
            guitar as an adult.

            And I have been a computer nerd since the flute times.

            I first started toying with the idea of building a synthesizer back
            in 2014, but lost my drive before finishing it.

            During the pandemic in 2020, without knowing anything about embedded
            systems, being mediocre at music theory and subpar at maths, I have
