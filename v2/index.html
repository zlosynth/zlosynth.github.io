          up to 18 simultaneous voices
          many wavetables, smooth transitions
          balances harmony, if you don't know anything, you don't need to, if you know some, this should allow you to elevate it
          detunes for thick sound, from lush pads to cacophony from hell
          various chord building modes allowing for different styles of playing
          display for easy dial in and visual cues

          <h2>installation</h2>
          <p>
            Achordion is 10 HP wide Eurorack module. It is powered by +12V/-12V
            2x5 connector. The red stripe (-12V) should be connected on the side
            of the board marked with the white line. The boxed power connector
            should make it easier to connect with the right polarity.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="right">
          <h2>controls, inputs and outputs</h2>
          <p>
            On the left side, there is a column of <b>LED diodes</b>&nbsp;(<b>X</b>) that
            are visualizing the currently selected parameter. Below the LEDs,
            there is a <b>button</b>&nbsp;(<b>Y</b>) that allows access to
            alternative parameters of each of the knobs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>WAVETABLE</b> (<b>A</b>) knob selects the wavetable. When the
            button (<b>Y</b>) is held down, this knob scrolls through wavetable
            banks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>TONE</b> (<b>B</b>) knob selects root note that should be playing. When the
            button (<b>Y</b>) is held down, this knob is used to select tonic of
            the scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>DETUNE</b> (<b>C</b>) knob controlls spread of secondary voices
            and amount of detune. When the button (<b>Y</b>) is held down, this
            knob controlls the scale mode.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>CHORD</b> (<b>D</b>) knob selects the chord or interval that
            should be playing. When the button (<b>Y</b>) is held down, this
            knob selects the mode in which chords are built.
          </p>
          <p>
            CV inputs <b>TONE</b> (<b>1</b>) and <b>TONE'</b> (<b>2</b>) used to
            control the root note that is playing on the main and side line,
            respectively. When <b>TONE</b> is connected, the <b>TONE</b> knob
            controlls octave offset. These inputs follow 1V/oct standard,
            between 0 and +10 V.
          </p>
          <p>
            CV inputs <b>TABLE</b> (<b>3</b>), <b>DETUNE</b> (<b>4</b>)
            and <b>CHORD</b> (<b>5</b>) are used to control the same attributes
            as the knobs described above. The value selected by the knob is
            added to the value set through CV. These inputs span between -5 and
            +5 V.
          </p>
          <p>
            Audio outputs <b>OUT</b> (<b>6</b>) and <b>OUT'</b> (<b>7</b>) play
            the main and the side line respectively. When only one is connected,
            the outputs are mixed together.
          </p>

      <div class="row">

          <h2>two voices</h2>
          <p>
            The module has two voices, primary and secondary. The pitch of these
            voices can be controlled independencly while all the other attributes
            are shared.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary voice is controlled through the <b>TONE</b> knob and
            CV input. The primary voice can play a chord, controlled through
            the <b>CHORD</b> knob and CV input.
          </p>
          <p>
            The secondary voice is controlled through the <b>TONE'</b> CV input
            and is playing only when a jack is connected. Unlike the primary
            voice, the secondary is not playing chords.
          </p>

          <h2>wavetables</h2>
          <p>
            There are 37 wavetables to select from, divided into 4 banks to select from:
          </p>
          <ol type="I">
            <li>
              <b>Perfect</b> – classic waveforms: triangle, sine, square and
              saw. All of these are containing pure harmonics.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Harsh</b> – full and distorted sounds. These can get very thick
              when played in rich chords.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Soft</b> – cleaner sounds and bells.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Sines</b> – the bottom half of this bank is a sequence of sine
              function multiplications providing variety of different sounds
              from clean to crazy noises. The upper half contains sums of sine
              functions, sliding through this them provides a low-pass filter
              effect.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The transitions between wavetables within a single bank are gradual
            and very smooth, suitable for live control through ADSR.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bank can be selected by pressing the <b>button</b> (<b>Y</b>)
            while turning the <b>WAVETABLE</b> (<b>A</b>) knob.
          </p>

          <h2>detune</h2>
          <p>
            This parameter is set through the <b>DETUNE</b> knob and CV input
            and controls number of secondary voices per each played note and
            their detune. The knob/CV input scrolls through three of these
            detune modes:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Disabled, only primary tones of the selected chord are playing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Single sub-octave, the first degree of the chord is duplicated one
              octave lower. This is a classic sub-octave.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each tone in the chord is duplicated once with a unisono. This
              produces slight movement or vibrato effect, depending on the
              amount of the detune.
            </li>
            <li>
              Two sub-octaves per each degree. This can produce very rich wall
              of sound and gets crazy with lot of detune.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            While moving through each of the modes, secondary voices are being
            gradually put them of tune. In lower detunes, the difference in
            frequency is very small and produces "beats" - making the sound
            moving and warm, when it is pushed higher it turns into a wild
            cacophony.
          </p>

          <h2>quantization</h2>
          <p>
            Quantizing makes sure that anything that comes out of the module
            stays in tune. Thanks to this, you can spend less time thinking
            about the harmony, easily play with other musicians, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            To select root note of the scale, hold the <b>button</b>
            while turning the <b>TONE</b>
            knob. <b>LEDs</b> <b>I</b>&nbsp;through&nbsp;<b>VII</b> then
            symbolize notes of C major: C,&nbsp;D,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;B.
            The <b>#</b>&nbsp;<b>LED</b> signalizes that the note is sharp.
          </p>
          <p>
            To select the scale mode, hold the <b>button</b> while turning
            the <b>DETUNE</b> knob. <b>LEDs</b> <b>I</b> through <b>VII</b> then
            symbolize each of the modes. Selected mode affects the mood or
            character of the tune you are playing:
          </p>
          <ol type="I">
            <li>Ionian (major)</li>
            <li>Dorian</li>
            <li>Phrygian</li>
            <li>Lydian</li>
            <li>Mixolydian</li>
            <li>Aeolian (minor)</li>
            <li>Locrian</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            If you are not a trained musician, don't despair, keep the default
            root note and pick one of the modes (I personally really like
            Dorian), just use you ears. If you know basics of music theory,
            being able to select the scale may enable you to combine this module
            with other instruments or other musicians.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <h2>chords</h2>
          <p>
            This module allows playing chords of up to 5 degrees, each of them
            affected by the detune.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to visualize selected chords, <b>LEDs</b> are displaying
            the degrees of them. For example, if the selected chord is basic
            fifth, LEDs I, III and V light up to signalize that first, third and
            fifth are playing. If this does not sound like anything to you,
            don't worry and just use your ears.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, there are three different modes of playing chords.
            These can be accessed by holding the <b>button</b> while turning
            the <b>CHORD</b> knob:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Chords</b> – assorted set of 19 chords. Starting with single
              note, followed-up with fifth, seventh, ninth and ninth inversions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Intervals</b> – not chords per-se. In this mode, the root note
              is accompanied by another note of interval between minus two
              octaves to plus octaves.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Arpeggios</b> – four different chords that are incrementally
              built while the parameter is being increased. Starting with the
              root, adding second degree, third, ... up to five degrees.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            You may wonder how to select minor or major chords. Thanks to
            quantization, the quality of each chord is selected automatically,
            based on the root note, in order to stay in tune.
          </p>

          <h2>split output</h2>
          <p>
            There are two audio outputs in the module: <b>OUT</b>
            and <b>OUT'</b>. When only one of these outputs is connected, it
            gets mixed with the unconnected one. When both outputs are
            connected, each plays a different line. This allows to run each line
            through a different effect chain.
          </p>
          <p>
            The content of these lines depends on the playing voices. If the
            secondary voice is playing, <b>OUT</b> plays the primary voice,
            controlled by <b>TONE</b> and <b>OUT'</b> is playing the secondary
            voice, controlled by <b>TONE'</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, when the secondary voice is not connected, <b>OUT</b>
            contains the root note of the primary voice, while <b>OUT'</b>
            contains the rest of the chord played by the primary voice.
          </p>

          <h2>calibration</h2>
          <p>
            While inputs <b>TONE</b> and <b>TONE'</b> should match the 1V/oct
            standard by default, they may be little off, either due to used
            components or the CV source not matching the standard precisely. It
            is possible to calibrate each of these inputs individually for their
            CV source. To do so, follow this procedure:
          </p>
          <ol class="arabic">
            <li>While pressing the <b>button</b>, connect jack to the input.</li>
            <li>The left column of <b>LEDs</b> should light up.</li>
            <li>Play the note <b style="color: #aa0000;">C</b> on the CV source and press the <b>button</b>.</li>
            <li>Now the right column of <b>LEDs</b> should light up.</li>
            <li>Play the note <b style="color: #008000;">C</b> one octave higher and press the <b>button</b> again.</li>
          </ol>
          <img src="piano.svg" style="border-radius: 0; margin-bottom: 30px;">
          <p>
            If you don't use a keyboard as a <b>TONE</b> input, there is no need
            to calibrate.
          </p>

          <h2>reset</h2>
          <p>
            To reset calibration and all saved secondary parameters (wavetable
            bank, scale tonic, scale mode, chord mode), hold the <b>button</b>
            pressed while powering on the module.
